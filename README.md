The following program is designed to mimic sand particles and how they would interact in water, this is more so a proof-of-concept and the particles do not exhibit any complicated behavior.

They are modeled after cellular automata and react/interact with their surroundings based on immediate cell neighbors.

I am planning on expanding on this by creating various particle objects (air, wood, stone etc..) in addition to the existing ones in a new project to show the variation betweem modular 
objects that can have different attributes vs a pseudo-simulated environment.
